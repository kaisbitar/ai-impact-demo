## **Privacy Policy**

**Effective date:** April 9, 2025

### **1. Overview**

This Chrome extension is designed solely to help users estimate the environmental impact of their AI usage, specifically their interactions with ChatGPT. The extension processes data locally to calculate approximate energy usage and CO₂ emissions per session.

We respect your privacy. This extension does **not collect**, **store**, or **share** personal information with any third party. All computations are done locally in your browser.

---

### **2. Data Collection and Usage**

The extension may access and process the following types of data **strictly for the purpose of calculating environmental metrics**:

- **User Interaction Data**  
  Detects when you interact with the ChatGPT interface (e.g., opening a ChatGPT tab or submitting a prompt). This is used to trigger environmental impact calculations.

- **Message Content**  
  The text of your interactions with ChatGPT may be analyzed **locally** to estimate the number of tokens used. This data is never stored, sent, or shared.

- **Local Usage History**  
  Environmental impact statistics (e.g., energy usage and emissions over time) may be saved locally using browser storage. These values remain entirely on your device and are only accessible to the extension.

- **Email Address (Required for Lifetime Stats)**  
  When you choose to view lifetime statistics, we collect your email address to enable access to your historical data. This is required for the functionality.

- **Marketing Emails (Optional)**  
  Separately, you can opt-in to receive tips on using AI more eco-consciously. This requires explicit consent via checkbox and can be withdrawn at any time.

---

### **3. Data Storage and Security**

Most data used by this extension is processed in your browser. Email addresses are stored securely in our database when you choose to provide them.

- **Local Storage**:  
  Usage statistics remain on your device. If you uninstall the extension, all locally stored data will be deleted.

- **Email Storage**:  
  Email addresses are stored securely in our encrypted database (Supabase) with access controls and monitoring.

- **No remote code execution**:  
  This extension does not execute or load JavaScript or WebAssembly from external sources.

### **4. Analytics**

We may use [Google Analytics for Chrome Extensions](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/tut_analytics/) to understand general usage patterns. This includes:

- Extension installs/uninstalls
- Feature usage (non-personal and aggregated)
- Error logs or performance metrics (aggregated)

---

### **5. Data Sharing**

We do **not** sell, rent, or share user data with any third party.

- Usage statistics are not transferred outside of the extension.
- Email addresses are only used for the stated purposes (lifetime stats access and optional updates).
- We do not use or transfer data for advertising, user profiling, or credit assessment.

You have the following rights regarding your email data:

- **Access**: Request to view what email data we have about you
- **Rectification**: Correct any inaccurate email information
